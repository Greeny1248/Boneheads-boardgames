# Boneheads Boardgames

Frontend software for the full stack application I created in conjunction with Northcoders' award-winning bootcamp, Boneheads BoardGames, this app contains a variety of features, such as the ability to view game reviews; reading individual reviews and comments; and providing the ability to post and delete ones own comments. Reviews can be sorted and filtered using the bar below the website's logo. Additionally, this app has a number of other features, some of which are listed on the website below...
